Linux patches 3.0.83, 3.2.47, 3.4.50 and 3.9.7. Since 3.9.7, the dmesg restrict patch is in the kernel and therefore has been removed from genpatches; furthermore, with that version we have added a stable queue patch that deals with the I/O errors commonly seen in Portage output as per bug #459674. Also, three patches were added to introduce BFQ support which remains completely optional as it is off by default and therefore not compiled into the kernel unless you toggle it on in the menuconfig. There exists a chance that we add a very small amount of such popular optional patches to spare large groups of users and other maintainers from having to add, track and maintain them theirselves. Since 3.9 is not near EOL yet the BFQ patches were added to give them a try, this was requested in #gentoo-kernel, feedback on this idea is welcome; on a side note, the author of BFQ is planning to upstream them so we might see them go into the main kernel in the nearby future.
