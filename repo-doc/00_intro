Repository layout for linux-patches/genpatches-2.6
==================================================

trunk: Trunk only contains the 0000_README file and one generic patch

branch: For each kernel branch we support we have a correspding branch in 
		our repo. We have branches at the minor level. e.g. 3.14,3.15,etc

tags: Whenever we snapshot a branch and release it in tarballs, we tag it in
      the repository, as the full kernel name plus our own release version,
	  e.g. 2.6.11-9

historical: When we stop actively developing a branch, we move the branch as-is
            to here. TODO

Checking out the working repository
===================================

Most of the time, you will only need to work under trunk - there is no point
checking out all the tagged and historical branches.
